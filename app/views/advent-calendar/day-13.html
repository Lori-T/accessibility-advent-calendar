    Automated accessibility testing tools play an important role in identifying potential barriers to web accessibility. These tools can quickly scan websites and provide insights into common accessibility issues, helping developers and designers create more inclusive digital experiences. While automated tools cannot catch every accessibility issue (as they don't replicate a real user experience), they form an essential part of an accessibility testing toolkit.  
  </p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What are automated accessibility testing tools?</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Automated accessibility testing tools are software or online services, like browser plugins, that evaluate web pages against accessibility standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). They check for issues like colour contrast, missing alternative text for images, keyboard navigation problems, and HTML structure errors as well as incorrect <a href="/advent-calendar/day12" class="govuk-link"></a> use of ARIA</a>.

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Validating your HTML</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">Before you run browser-based automated testing tools, ensure your HTML is valid and fix any errors. Accessibility relies on your HTML being correct. The Department for Work and Pensions Accessibility Manual includes some great <a href="https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/best-practice/validating-html/#html-validator" class="govuk-link">guidance on validating your HTML</a> using tools such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-validator" class="govuk-link">HTML Validator</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Benefits of automated accessibility testing</h2>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li><strong>speed</strong>: automated tools can scan entire websites quickly, catching issues that might be overlooked during manual testing.</li>
    <li><strong>efficiency</strong>: these tools help developers prioritise accessibility fixes by identifying the most critical issues.</li>
    <li><strong>consistency</strong>: automated tools provide consistent results, helping ensure that accessibility is not overlooked during development or updates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Limitations of automated accessibility testing</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Automated testing tools are useful as part of an accessibility testing process, however they can't be used alone to understand full accessibility compliance or usability of a website or service. Using a combination of automated tools they still only pick up a  maximum of 30-40% coverage of accessibility issues. <a href="https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/" class="govuk-link">GDS conducted an audit of automated tools</a> which shows performance for many different tools.</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li><strong>false positives and negatives</strong>: automated tools may report issues that arenâ€™t actual problems or miss issues that need attention.</li>
    <li><strong>user experience</strong>: tools cannot fully assess the user experience of disabled people, so manual testing is still essential for a complete accessibility audit.</li>
  </ul>

    Automated accessibility testing tools are an invaluable asset in the web development process, but they should be used in combination with manual testing for the best results. By integrating these tools into your testing process, you can catch common accessibility issues early.
