    <p class="govuk-body">
      <strong>Digital accessibility</strong> means designing and building digital services—websites, apps, documents, and more—so they can be used by everyone, including disabled people. 
      This includes people who rely on assistive technologies, such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, or voice input software.
