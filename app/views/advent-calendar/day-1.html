    <p class="govuk-body">
      <strong>Digital accessibility</strong> means designing and building digital services—websites, apps, documents, and more—so they can be used by everyone, including disabled people. This includes people who rely on assistive technologies, such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, or voice input software.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why does it matter?</h2>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Ensures equitable access to information, products, and services for all users.</li>
      <li>Meets the legal requirements under the Equality Act 2010 and the Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018.</li>
      <li>Supports the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK Service Standard</a>, which prioritises accessible service design.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who benefits from accessibility?</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      <strong>Everyone benefits from accessibility</strong> but it is particularly important for:
    </p>

      <li>people with mobility impairments who cannot use a mouse or keyboard.</li>
      <li>people with cognitive impairments, such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, or neurodivergence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How do people access websites and services?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">People access websites, services and mobile applications in a number of different ways, including:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
       <li>by using a mobile or tablet to access the internet or use apps.</li>  
        <li>using a desktop or laptop computer.</li>
        <li>by customising browser settings to change how a website looks.</li>
      <li>using screen readers to convert text into speech or Braille.</li>
      <li>using screen magnifiers to enlarge text and graphics.</li>
      <li>relying on speech recognition to control devices and dictate text.</li>
        <li>using different input devices such as a mouse, keyboard, sip and puff devices or other input devices</li>

    </ul>
