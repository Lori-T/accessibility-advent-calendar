  <p class="govuk-body">
    Keyboard accessibility ensures that everyone, including users who rely on assistive technologies or cannot use a mouse, can interact with your website or application. This is vital for people with motor impairments, people who use screen readers, those with temporary injuries, or anyone who simply prefers using a keyboard.
  </p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why keyboard accessibility matters</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Websites and applications should be fully navigable using only a keyboard. This enables users to perform all essential actions, such as filling out forms, navigating menus, and submitting information, without relying on a mouse or touchpad. Supporting keyboard accessibility also ensures compatibility with other input devices, such as switches or voice commands.
  </p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Common keyboard accessibility issues</h2>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>unreachable elements: Interactive components like buttons, links, and form fields are not focusable or operable using a keyboard, making them inaccessible.</li>
    <li>improper focus order: Focus moves in an illogical or confusing order, making navigation difficult.</li>
    <li>keyboard traps: Users get stuck and cannot move past or return to other elements.</li>
    <li>missing or inadequate focus indicators: If no visible focus indicators are used—or they are poorly implemented—keyboard users cannot see which element is currently focused, leaving them unsure of their position.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Tips for improving keyboard accessibility</h2>
  <ul class="govuk-list">
    <li><strong>make all interactive elements focusable</strong>: Use semantic HTML for elements like <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>. For custom components, ensure they are operable using <code>tabindex</code> and ARIA roles or properties where necessary.</li>
    <li><strong>ensure a logical focus order</strong>: Check that the tab order follows the natural reading flow of the page. Avoid unexpected jumps that disrupt navigation.</li>
    <li><strong>provide a visible focus indicator</strong>: Style the <code>:focus</code> state using CSS to make the currently focused element visible. Visit the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/focus-states/" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK Design System focus states</a> for more guidance.</li>
    <li><strong>enable keyboard navigation for complex widgets</strong>: For components like modals, dropdowns, and carousels, support keyboard actions such as arrow keys for navigation and the <code>Escape</code> key to close.</li>
    <li><strong>add skip links</strong>: Implement skip links to allow users to bypass repeated elements (e.g., navigation) and go directly to the main content of the page.</li>
  </ul>



  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Keyboard commands reference</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    The following table outlines common keyboard commands that should be supported for accessibility. This is not an exhaustive list.
   </p>

   <table class="govuk-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Testing keyboard accessibility</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    You can test your website by unplugging your mouse and navigating entirely with the keyboard. When testing, check the following:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list">
    <li>you can tell where you are on the page (visible focus)</li>
    <li>the tabbing order makes logical sense</li>
    <li>nothing unexpected happens when tabbing through a page</li>
    <li>you do not get stuck in a keyboard trap</li>
    <li>forms are fully usable without a mouse</li>
    <li>skip links work, allowing users to bypass navigation</li>
    <li>content remains usable when zoomed in, magnified, or with enlarged text</li>
    <li>the page behaves as expected when users zoom in</li>
  </ul>
