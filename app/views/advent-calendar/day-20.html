<p class="govuk-body">
  Progressive enhancement is a design approach that ensures everyone can access the essential content and functionality of a website, regardless of their device, browser, or abilities.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Government websites and services must use progressive enhancement, even if part of the service uses JavaScript.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What is progressive enhancement?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Progressive enhancement starts with a solid foundation of HTML to deliver content and core functionality. Enhancements like Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity are layered on top, ensuring that the site works for everyone even if advanced features are unavailable.
</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">A Christmas Tree Analogy</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Think of a Christmas tree: at its core, it’s a plain, green tree. It serves its purpose as a Christmas centerpiece, bringing warmth and festivity into the home, even if it’s undecorated.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  The tree itself represents the core HTML—a solid, functional foundation that everyone can enjoy.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  The decorations and lights are like CSS, making the tree visually appealing and festive but not essential.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  The twinkling lights or ornaments that play music are like JavaScript—nice enhancements that bring interactivity and extra magic, but if they stop working, the tree is still functional and beautiful.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  <img src="{{asset_path}}images/xmastree.png" padding="10px" class="responsive-image" alt="two Christmas trees, one is undecorated in a pot with a robin sitting on it, the other is fully decorated with tinsel, baubles and lights.">
  </p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why it matters for accessibility</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Progressive enhancement matters for accessibility because it:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>ensures universal access, especially for users on older devices or with limited internet connections</li>
  <li>makes websites compatible with assistive technologies like screen readers and braille displays</li>
  <li>provides a reliable experience even if CSS or JavaScript fails</li>
  <li>improves resilience to browser and technology disruptions</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">JavaScript and accessibility</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  JavaScript is a programming language that allows developers to create interactive webpages and applications. If implemented correctly it can enance accessibility but only if people can access it.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Why JavaScript can be accessible but isn’t always available</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">
  JavaScript can make websites more accessible by:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>creating dynamic, interactive features like pop-up alerts and form validation</li>
  <li>improving usability for users with disabilities when combined with proper ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">
  However, these enhancements depend on users being able to access JavaScript. If it fails to load or run, users are left without these improvements—and in some cases, without basic functionality.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  For example:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>If a JavaScript-powered button doesn’t fall back to a standard HTML <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, keyboard-only users might be unable to activate it</li>
  <li>If an accessible form validation feature relies entirely on JavaScript, users without JavaScript will never know if their input is valid</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Why JavaScript can fail to run or load</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  JavaScript can fail to load or run for many reasons beyond the control of users, such as:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>temporary network errors</li>
  <li>third-party browser extensions like ad blockers</li>
  <li>third-party supplier downtime, such as issues with content delivery networks (CDNs)</li>
  <li>DNS lookup failures</li>
  <li>bugs introduced by browser updates</li>
  <li>bugs introduced by third-party JavaScript running on the same page</li>
  <li>corporate firewalls blocking, removing, or changing content (for example, in banks or government departments)</li>
  <li>mobile network providers changing content to speed up load times or reduce bandwidth usage</li>
  <li>personal firewalls or antivirus software blocking or altering content</li>
  <li>unsecure connections, where internet providers insert their own code that conflicts with your page</li>
</ul>
<p>If your website relies
  entirely on JavaScript without providing a fallback, users could be left
  unable to interact with it. </p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Additionally, some users may deliberately turn off JavaScript in their browsers for privacy, security, or performance reasons. You should respect their decision and ensure that your website remains functional without JavaScript.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Challenges with single-page applications (SPAs)</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">
  
  Single-page websites or applications dynamically update content without reloading the entire page, While this improves performance and interactivity, it can create barriers for users with disabilities and are generally not recommended for government or accessible web services for the following reasons:

</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><strong>users of assistive technology would be unaware of changes in context</strong>, for example, when moving to a new page. SPAs load new content dynamically without a full page refresh, meaning screen readers and other assistive technologies may not detect the change.</li>
  <li><strong>focus management is often not handled properly when moving between pages</strong> this can make it difficult for keyboard users and screen reader users to navigate the page effectively and could lead to confusion about where they are on the site.</li>
  <li><strong>navigation becomes problematic</strong> as users may be unable to use the back or forward buttons in their browser to revisit previous pages. This can also affect users who rely on browser history for navigation.</li>
  <li><strong>error recovery can be difficult </strong>especially if there is an interruption to the network connection or other technical issues. Without full page reloads, users may struggle to recover from errors or lost states within the application.</li>
</ul>


<div class="govuk-inset-text">

 Make sure JavaScript builds on HTML. When implemented well, JavaScript can enhance accessibility. But always start with a solid HTML foundation and ensure the website remains functional even if users cannot access JavaScript.
</div>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">A festive example: progressive elf-hancements</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
<img src="{{asset_path}}images/elfcar.png" padding="10px" class="responsive-image" alt="An elf holding a toy car next to a stack of presents">
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Imagine a toy car. At its core, it works as a pull-back car: you pull it back, release it, and it zooms forward. This basic functionality is reliable and doesn’t require additional components like batteries. Everyone can play with it as long as they know how to pull it back.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Now imagine the car has an optional battery-powered feature. With batteries, it can drive forward automatically, light up, or even make sound effects. These features are exciting and add extra fun, but they aren’t essential to the car’s main purpose: to roll forward when you interact with it.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Similarly, in progressive enhancement:  
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>the pull-back functionality represents core HTML—a solid, functional foundation that works for everyone</li>
  <li>the battery-powered features, like lights and sound, are like CSS and JavaScript—enhancements that add value but aren’t essential</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to apply progressive enhancement</h2>
<p>To apply progressive enhancement:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>start with clean, semantic HTML for core content and functionality</li>
  <li>use CSS to enhance the visual experience without compromising usability</li>
  <li>add JavaScript for interactivity, but ensure non-JavaScript fallbacks are available</li>
  <li>test your site with tools and techniques for accessibility</li>
</ul>

  <div class="govuk-inset-text">
  By embracing progressive enhancement, you create a robust and inclusive web experience that works for all users, no matter their circumstances. It’s not just about meeting accessibility standards—it’s about making the web better for everyone.
