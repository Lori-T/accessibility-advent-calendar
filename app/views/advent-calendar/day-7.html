  <p class="govuk-body">
    Today, focuses on the importance of <strong>colour contrast</strong> in digital content. Colour contrast is crucial for ensuring that text and visual elements on websites and applications are readable and accessible to everyone, including people with low vision and colour blindness.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Ensuring that there is enough contrast between text and background colours can improve legibility for everyone, not just those with disabilities.
  </p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why is colour contrast important?</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Poor colour contrast can make it difficult for users with visual impairments to read text or interact with content. This is especially true for users with:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>low vision</li>
    <li>colour blindness (for example, red-green colour blindness)</li>
    <li>older age, which can result in reduced contrast sensitivity</li>
  </ul>
     <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Types of colour blindness.</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    There are seven official diagnoses of colour blindness: four different types of color blindness fall in the red-green category, two are in the blue-yellow spectrum and one version describes a type of vision completely lacking color. These are:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>protanopia (aka red-blind)</li>
    <li>protanomaly (aka red-weak) – individuals usually see some shades of red</li>
    <li>deuteranopia (aka green-blind).</li>
    <li>deuteranomaly (aka green-weak) – Individuals can usually see some shades of green</li> 
    <li>tritanopia (aka blue-blind) </li>
    <li>tritanomaly (aka blue-weak) – Individuals can usually see some shades of blue</li>
    <li>monochromacy (achromatopsia) - people cannot see any colour at all</li>
    <li>there is also a condition called tetrachromacy which affects some women, this is also known as 'super colour vision' and allows them to see 100 times more colour than the rest of the population</li>

 <p class=""gov-body">In 2012, accessibility improvements were made to the BBC football league tables where win, lose and draw were shown using red, green and grey coloured lines. The improvements added letters for win (W), lose (L) and draw (D) so that the infomation did not rely on colour alone to be percieved. </p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to ensure good colour contrast</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend the following contrast ratios:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li><strong>Text:</strong> At least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text and a 3:1 ratio for large text (18px and above or 14px bold).</li>
    <li><strong>UI Components:</strong> Interactive elements such as buttons and links should have a contrast ratio of 3:1 against their background.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Here are a few tips to improve the contrast on your site:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>use dark text on light backgrounds as this combination generally offers better contrast and readability.</li>
    <li>avoid using colour alone to convey information, for example, if you're using red to indicate an error, make sure you also provide a clear label or icon so it’s understandable for users with colour blindness.</li>
    <li>test across devices and ensure your colour choices look good on different screen types.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Testing colour contrast</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    You can test the contrast of your website using various online tools:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list">
    <li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" class="govuk-link">WebAIM Colour contrast checker</a>: An easy-to-use tool that lets you check the contrast ratio between foreground and background colours.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/" class="govuk-link">TPGI Color contrast checker:</a> A desktop tool that can analyse any area of your screen and give you contrast ratio for text and visual elements</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">
  If you’re unsure whether your design passes accessibility standards, try adjusting the colours to higher contrast settings on your device or browser. There are also browser extensions and tools that help you visualise your site’s contrast and ensure compliance with accessibility guidelines.
