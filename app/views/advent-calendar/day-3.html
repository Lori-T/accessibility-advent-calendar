The theme for this year is "Amplifying the leadership of persons with disabilities for an inclusive and sustainable future." This theme recognises the important role that persons with disabilities play in creating a more inclusive and sustainable world for all. It also emphasises the importance of the participation of persons with disabilities in decision-making processes that affect their lives.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What is a disability?</h2>

   <div class="govuk-inset-text"></div>"A person has a disability […] if they have a physical or mental impairment and the impairment has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities”
      - Equality Act 2010
      div>
      <p class="govuk-body"> Approximately 1 in 4 people (24%) in the UK have a disability or long-term impairment. 
      These stats do not include unreported disabilities, neurodiversity (such as Autism or ADHD) or situational (for example, a new parent holding a baby) or temporary impairments (for example, a person with an arm injury)
</p>

     Permanent disability is a person with one arm
     Temporary disability is a person with an arm injury and their arm is in a sling
     Situational disability is a new parent holding a baby">

     <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Describing disability</h2>
     <p class="govuk-body">There are different models of disability that are used by different people. The way people talk about disability depends on the way they percieve their own experience and can be personal and can vary, there is no right way to describe or talk about disability</p>
     <p class="govuk-body"> When talking about disability, the UK public sector uses the social model of disability, that helps us recognise barriers that make life harder for disabled people (whereas the medical model refers to the disabilty or imapairment which causes the barriers).
